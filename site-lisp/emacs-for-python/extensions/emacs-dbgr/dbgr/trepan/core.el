  "Parse command line ARGS for the annotate level and name of script to debug.

ARGS should contain a tokenized list of the command line to run.

We return the a list containing
- the command processor (e.g. ruby) and it's arguments if any - a list of strings
- the name of the debugger given (e.g. trepan) and its arguments - a list of strings
- the script name and its arguments - list of strings
- whether the annotate or emacs option was given ('-A', '--annotate' or '--emacs) - a boolean

For example for the following input 
  (map 'list 'symbol-name
   '(ruby1.9 -W -C /tmp trepan --emacs ./gcd.rb a b))

we might return:
   ((ruby1.9 -W -C) (trepan --emacs) (./gcd.rb a b) 't)

NOTE: the above should have each item listed in quotes.
