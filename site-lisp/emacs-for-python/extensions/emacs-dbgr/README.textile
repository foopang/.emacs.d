h1. Introduction

Towards a modular framework for interacting with external debuggers.

Debuggers we currently support are:

 * bashdb  (BASH)
 * gdb  
 * kshdb (Korn Shell)
 * pydb (Python)
 * pydbgr (Python)
 * trepanning (Ruby 1.9)
 * remake (GNU Make)
 * ruby-debug (Ruby)
 * zshdb (Zsh)

The debugger is run out of a comint process buffer, or you can use a "track-mode" inside an existing shell.

To install you'll need a couple of other Emacs packages installed. See "the installation instructions":http://wiki.github.com/rocky/emacs-dbgr/how-to-install for details.
